In the case of regression problems, mean squared error is used, and in classification problems, logarithmic loss will be used. In boosting, at each stage, unexplained loss from prior iterations will be optimized rather than starting from scratch.\n","\n","* **Weak learner to make predictions**: Decision trees are used as a weak learner in gradient boosting.\n","\n","* **Additive model to add weak learners to minimize the loss function**: Trees are added one at a time and existing trees in the model are not changed. The gradient descent procedure is used to minimize the loss when adding trees."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"id":"0dy7SMo0XCGW","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"R9jetPXRXCGX","colab_type":"code","outputId":"408237aa-b0d9-4d77-e11a-275d3eb9a0d3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1571208206027,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":716,"user":{"displayName":"Anthony Ng","photoUrl":"","userId":"01122201020865534731"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":187}},"source":["gbc_clf = GradientBoostingClassifier()\n","gbc_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["GradientBoostingClassifier(criterion='friedman_mse', init=None,\n","                           learning_rate=0.1, loss='deviance', max_depth=3,\n","                           max_features=None, max_leaf_nodes=None,\n","                           min_impurity_decrease=0.0, min_impurity_split=None,\n","                           min_samples_leaf=1, min_samples_split=2,\n","                           min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0, n_estimators=100,\n","                           n_iter_no_change=None, presort='auto',\n","                           random_state=None, subsample=1.0, tol=0.0001,\n","                           validation_fraction=0.1, verbose=0,\n","                           warm_start=False)"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":37}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"iYQ3TrZ7XCGZ","colab_type":"code","outputId":"86379109-3fd2-45e6-9d6e-015f9f3a4220","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1571208214278,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":951,"user":{"displayName":"Anthony Ng","photoUrl":"","userId":"01122201020865534731"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":816}},"source":["print_score(gbc_clf, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, train=True)\n","print(\"\\n*****************************\\n\")\n","print_score(gbc_clf, X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, train=False)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Train Result:\n","\n","accuracy score: 0.9528\n","\n","Classification Report: \n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.91      0.91      0.91        35\n","           1       0.97      0.97      0.97        92\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.95       127\n","   macro avg       0.94      0.94      0.94       127\n","weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95       127\n","\n","\n","Confusion Matrix: \n"," [[32  3]\n"," [ 3 89]]\n","\n","ROC AUC: 0.9408\n","\n","Average Accuracy: \t 0.8408\n","Accuracy SD: \t\t 0.0927\n","\n","*****************************\n","\n","Test Result:\n","\n","accuracy score: 0.5636\n","\n","Classification Report: \n","               precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.50      0.38      0.43        24\n","           1       0.59      0.71      0.65        31\n","\n","    accuracy                           0.56        55\n","   macro avg       0.55      0.54      0.54        55\n","weighted avg       0.55      0.56      0.55        55\n","\n","\n","Confusion Matrix: \n"," [[ 9 15]\n"," [ 9 22]]\n","\n","ROC AUC: 0.5423\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ef-WXfxzXCGb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["***"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5HhUEZdcXCGb","colab_type":"text"},"source":["| Classifier | Decision Tree | Bagging | Random Forest | Optimised RF | Extra-Trees | AdaBoost (CART) | AdaBoost (RF) | Gradient Boosting |\n","|:-|:-|:- |:- |:- |:- |:-|:-| :- |\n","| Train accuracy score | 0.9528 | 0.9528 | 0.9325 | 0.9264 | 0.9448 | 0.8661 | 0.9528 | 0.9449 |\n","| Average accuracy score | 0.7724 | 0.7879 | 0.7801 | 0.7059 | 0.7548 | 0.7793 | 0.7353 | 0.7906 |\n","| SD | 0.1018 | 0.1008 | 0.1474 | 0.1308 | 0.1406 | 0.1172 | 0.0881 | 0.0912 |\n","| Test accuracy score | 0.7636 | 0.7455 | 0.7895 | 0.6316 | 0.7895 | 0.6545 | 0.7818 | 0.7818 |\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3AW7n-zjXCGc","colab_type":"text"},"source":["***"]}]}
